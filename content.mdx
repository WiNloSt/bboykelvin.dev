# About me
My name is Kelvin and I'm a front-end developer. I love coding and make the code simple, I'm also a mechanical keyboard geek and like cute stuff üòç.

Actually, I started off being a back-end developer for about 2 years, until I realized I have more fun working on front-end stuff, so I quite my job and start learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from ground up. And after 3 months, I landed a job on 2016 as a front-end developer and the rest is history.
